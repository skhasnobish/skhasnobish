As a dedicated and knowledgeable individual with a passion for technology, I have a rich educational background in Computer Systems Technology and Software Engineering.

I completed an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Technology from Seneca College, where I gained comprehensive knowledge of computer networking. My studies focused on Unix/Linux OS, bash shell scripting, and the operations of routers, switches, hubs, and other network devices using Cisco Packet Tracer. I also developed skills in database management using SQL and MySQL and gained experience in Active Directory configurations using Windows Server OS.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering Technology from McMaster University. This program has allowed me to delve deeper into the realm of technology, learning about computer security, web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, React Native, and NodeJS, and programming with Python.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in my studies, I enjoy staying active by playing sports, keeping up-to-date with current events through news articles, and unwinding with a good movie.

I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for technology to make a positive impact in the field of software engineering. Feel free to connect with me for opportunities, collaborations, or exchanges of ideas.
